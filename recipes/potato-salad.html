        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>There are many ways to make potato salad, but if you're looking for a traditional, mayonnaise-based potato salad made with hard-boiled eggs, celery, and a little pickle relish for zing, you've landed on the right recipe.</p>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, cool, peel and chop.</li>
            <li>While potatoes cook, place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop.</li>
            <li>Combine the potatoes, eggs, celery, onion, relish, mayonnaise, mustard, garlic salt, celery salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix together well and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
        </ol>
