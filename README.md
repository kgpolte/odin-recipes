# odin-recipes

This is a project for The Odin Project to practice basic HTML skills and the Git workflow.

## Reflection

This project was good for getting comfortable with the Git workflow and thinking about writing good commit messages.

I also practiced creating, moving, and renaming files from the terminal. I created some html elements for each page, including headers, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

I did not apply any style to the website because I haven't covered CSS yet.

## To-Do List

- Improve upon the current state of the website by adding ingredient lists, more images, and more detailed instructions.

- Add a link to return to the homepage on each recipe page.

- Add a review for each recipe.

- Add more information about the site to the homepage.
